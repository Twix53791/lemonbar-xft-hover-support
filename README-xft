Personal fork of lemonbar-xft, with hover support
=================================================
This fork add the possibily to execute commands on
enter/leave window mouse events (hover).
It is inspired by a pull request[3] of Siers.[4]

The protesilaos fork get downloaded from the Ronasimi repo on git hub.

Protesilaos original fork:
==========================

The purpose of this fork is to keep up with upstream while maintaining
the changes by GitHub user krypt-n who seems to have lots interest in
the project.[0]

The contributions by krypt-n allow Xft support (to use typefaces
supported by fontconfig).  Upstream Lemonbar appears to be unable or
unwilling to merge them into master.[1]

I have decided to maintain this project, because I want to use it as
part of my custom desktop session on Debian 10 Buster.[2]
